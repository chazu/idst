To run the examples either:

1. copy 'cairo/*.dll' (three files) to a directory where the OS can
   find them (e.g., C:\WINDOWS\system32); or

2. add the 'cairo' directory to some environment variable that
   contains the list of places that the dynamic loader searches for dlls
   (don't ask me how to do this, I haven't the faintest idea).
