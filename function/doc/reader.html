<h2>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>


Coke includes a built-in scanner that converts a plain text,
parenthesized representation of s-expressions into object structures
that represent equivalent ASTs.  Although ambitious language
processors will certainly replace this scanner with a more exotic and
powerful parsing mechanism, the scanner is designed to be fully
programmable and extensible from userland dynamic code.


<h2>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scanner loop</h2>


The scanner reads characters from a stream and answers the object they
represent.  Every character is <i>active</i>; in other words, for
every character read from the stream the scanner finds a <i>reader
method</i> and invokes it on the stream.  If the reader method answers
non-nil, the answer is returned to the scanner's caller.  If the
reader answers nil, the scanner continues with the next character on
the stream.  (The scanner therefore answers nil only when the stream
is empty.)

<blockquote><pre>Scanner read: stream
[
  | char reader object |
  [stream atEnd]
    whileFalse:
     [char := stream peek.
      reader := readers at: char.
      object := self performMethod: reader with: stream.
      object notNil ifTrue: [^object]].
  ^nil
]
</pre></blockquote>

For example, the comment character (;) is associated with the
following method:

<blockquote><pre>Scanner readComment: stream
[
  [stream atEnd or: [stream next == $\n]] whileFalse.
  ^nil
]
</pre></blockquote>

The method gobbles the entire line after the comment character,
including the end of line character.  Since <tt>readComment:</tt>
answers nil, the scanner does not return a result to its caller but
continues scanning immediately with the first character on the next
line. <p>

The scanner is re-entrant.  For example, the quote character (&apos;)
is associated with a method that invokes the scanner recursively:

<blockquote><pre>Scanner readQuote: stream
[
  stream next.	<i>"gobble the '"</i>
  ^Expression with: #quote with: (self read: stream)
]
</pre></blockquote>

This converts the
text <blockquote><pre>'<i>anything</i></pre></blockquote>
into the list
<blockquote><pre>(quote <i>anything</i>)</pre></blockquote>. <p>

The scanner can also read a list of objects from the stream, stopping
at an arbitrary delimiting character.  This method is invoked whenever
an opening parenthesis is encountered:

<blockquote><pre>Scanner readOpenParen: stream
[
  | list |
  stream next.	<i>"gobble the ("</i>
  list := self read: stream list: Expression delimited: $).
  stream next.	<i>"gobble the )"</i>
  ^list
]
</pre></blockquote>

Reader functions are installed and queried in a scanner using the
following protocol:

<blockquote><pre>
Scanner readerAt: aCharacter
Scanner readerAt: aCharacter put: readerMethod
Scanner readerAt: firstCharacter through: lastCharacter put: readerMethod
</pre></blockquote>

For example, during initialisation the Coke scanner sends itself these
messages:

<blockquote><pre>
self
  readerAt: $(             put: (self _methodAt: #readOpenParen:);
  readerAt: $0 through: $9 put: (self _methodAt: #readDigit:);
  "... and so forth ..."
</pre></blockquote>


<h3>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attributes</h3>

Each character also has an associated attributes object.  One such
attribute is the symbol <tt>#id</tt> associated with any character
that can appear in the second (and subsequent) positions of an
identifier (symbol).  (Another is <tt>#space</tt>, associated with any
character that should be considered whitespace.)  <p>

Setting a reader method with either of the messages

<blockquote><pre>
Scanner readerAt: aCharacter put: readerMethod
Scanner readerAt: firstCharacter through: lastCharacter put: readerMethod
</pre></blockquote>

clears the attribute associated with the implicated characters. <p>

To associate a reader method and attribute with one or more
characters, two similar methods are provided:

<blockquote><pre>
Scanner readerAt: aCharacter put: readerMethod withAttribute: anObject
Scanner readerAt: firstCharacter through: lastCharacter put: readerMethod withAttribute: anObject
</pre></blockquote>

Finally, attributes can be accessed independently of reader methods:

<blockquote><pre>
Scanner attributeAt: aCharacter
Scanner attributeAt: aCharacter put: anObject
</pre></blockquote>

To illustrate these methods, the three messages

<blockquote><pre>
aScanner readerAt:    $$ put: (aScanner readerAt: $a).
aScanner readerAt:    $$ put: (aScanner readerAt: $a) withAttribute: #id.
aScanner attributeAt: $$ put: #id.
</pre></blockquote>

will ensure <tt>aScanner</tt> allows dollars as the initial character
of identifiers, anywhere in identifiers, or only in the second (and
subsequent) characters (but not the first) of identifiers,
respectively. <p>




<h3>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary modifications</h3>

The state of a scanner (associations between characters, reader
methods and attributes) can be saved and later restored in a LIFO
manner.  For example, the following parses one object from a stream
with the comment character disabled (it will act like a letter):

<blockquote><pre>
| object |
<i>"save the scanner's state"</i>
aScanner save.
<i>"convert ; into a comment"</i>
aScanner readerAt: $; put: (aScanner readerAt: $a) withAttribute: #id.
<i>"read the next object from aStream"</i>
object := aScanner read: aStream.
<i>"restore the scanner's state"</i>
aScanner restore.
</pre></blockquote>

Sends of <tt>save</tt> and <tt>restore</tt> to a given scanner nest
correctly and to an arbitrary depth.


<h3>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial state</h3>

A new 'empty' <tt>Scanner</tt> associates every character with a
reader that immediately signals an 'illegal character' error. <p>

During initialisation of the Coke scanner, the following additional
associations are installed:

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><i>character(s)</i></td>
  <td><i>reader method</i></td>
  <td><i>attribtue</i></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>space and control chars&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td>whitespace</td>
  <td><tt>#space</tt></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>0 through 9</td>
  <td>integer</td>
  <td><tt>#id</tt></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>(</td>
  <td>list</td>
  <td><tt></tt></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>)</td>
  <td>unexpected char</td>
  <td><tt></tt></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>&quot;</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td><tt></tt></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>&apos;</td>
  <td>quoted object</td>
  <td><tt></tt></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>;</td>
  <td>comment</td>
  <td><tt></tt></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>everthing else</i></td>
  <td>letter</td>
  <td><tt>#id</tt></td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>


<h2>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifying the scanner from within Coke</h2>


Methods expect three 'hidden' initial arguments: a vtable closure and
two 'self's (one for accessing state, one for sends to self).
Provided these arguments are specified before any arguments, the
reader table can be extended using <tt>lambda</tt> expressions from
within Coke. <p>

For example, if quotation were not provided by default it could be
added dynamically from Coke as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
(define CokeScanner (import "CokeScanner"))

(define read-quote
  (lambda (_closure _self self stream)
    [stream next]	<i>; gobble the &apos;</i>
    [Expression with: 'quote with: [self read: stream]]))

[CokeScanner readerAt: '$' put: read-quote]
</pre></blockquote>


<h2>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanner protocol</h2>

This section lists all public message to which <tt>Scanner</tt> responds.

<blockquote>

  </dd>
<br>
  <dt><tt>Scanner read: inputStream list: listType delimited: terminator</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    Scans objects from the <tt>inputStream</tt> until
    the <tt>terminator</tt> character is encountered (where the first
    character of an object would be expected).  Answers a collection
    of the given <tt>listType</tt> containing those objects, or
    <nil>if the end of stream is encountered.  The <tt>terminator</tt>
    character is removed from the <tt>inputStream</tt> and discarded.
  </dd>
<br>
  <dt><tt>Scanner ignoreSpaces: inputStream</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    Reads and discards characters from the <tt>inputStream</tt> as
    long as those characters attribute is <tt>#space</tt>.  Answers
    the first non-<tt>#space</tt> character, or <tt>nil</tt> if the
    end of the <tt>inputStream</tt> is reached.
  </dd>
<br>
  <dt><tt>Scanner read: inputStream string: stringType delimited: terminator withEscapes: escapeTable</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a collection of the given <tt>stringType</tt> and
    populates it with all objects (usually characters) read
    from <tt>inputStream</tt> until the <tt>terminator</tt> is
    encountered.  The <tt>terminator</tt> is removed from
    the <tt>inputStream</tt> and discarded.  If a backslash (\)
    character is encountered in the stream, the character following it
    is added to the string (even if it is the <tt>terminator</tt>)
    unless that character has a corresponding entry in
    the <tt>escapeTable</tt> in which case that entry's value is
    substituted.
  </dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>


<h2>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples</h2>


<h3>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanner macros</h3>

The Coke compiler is designed to be extended with new AST node types
(using the <tt>syntax</tt> form).  These are similar to macros but
work only on object structures.  More 'traditional' macros, performing
purely textual substitution, are not built into the scanner but can be
added by user code. <p>

First we need a small structure to hold macro definitions, which will
resemble closures, and a dictionary that maps macro names to their
definitions.

<blockquote><pre>
(syntax macro-method	(lambda (node comp) `(long@ ,[node second]  )))
(syntax macro-data	(lambda (node comp) `(long@ ,[node second] 1)))

(define make-macro
  (lambda (method data)
    (let ((macro (malloc 8)))
      (set (macro-method macro) method)
      (set (macro-data   macro) data)
      macro)))

(define %macros	[SlotDictionary new])
</pre></blockquote>

To define a macro we add a <tt>macro</tt> structure to this dictionary
associating the name with the closure.

<blockquote><pre>
(define define-macro
  (lambda (name method data)
    [%macros at: name put: (make-macro method data)]))
</pre></blockquote>

Macro (control sequence) names will be prefixed by the backslash (\)
character.  When the scanner sees this character it will invoke the
control-sequence reader:

<blockquote><pre>
(define cs-reader
  (method (stream)
    [stream next]
    (let ((csname [self read: stream]))
      (or [csname isSymbol] (error "missing control sequence name"))
      (let ((definition [%macros at: csname]))
	(or definition (error "undefined control sequence: \\%s" [[csname asString] _stringValue]))
	((macro-method definition) _closure _self self stream (macro-data definition))))))
</pre></blockquote>

A macro definition will be either a single object or a list of
objects.  To delimit lists of object we'll surround them with braces
({...}) to create a <i>group</i>.  (Closing braces should always be
consumed by the list reader and never seen by the scanner; they will
therefore be bound to an error method.)

<blockquote><pre>
(define group-reader
  (method (stream)
    [stream next]
    [self read: stream list: Expression delimited: '$\}]))

(define group-error
  (method (stream)
    [self error: stream unexpected: [stream peek]]))
</pre></blockquote>

The default behaviour for a macro will be to insert its data into the
parse.

<blockquote><pre>
(define %insert
  (method (stream data)
    data))
</pre></blockquote>

The only predefined macro will be the macro-defining macro.  Its
behaviour will be to scan forwards in the stream looking for a macro
name followed by either a single token or a group of tokens.

<blockquote><pre>
(define-macro 'def
  (method (stream data)
    (or (and [self ignoreSpaces: stream] (== '$\\ [stream next]))
	(error "missing control sequence name in \\def"))
    (let ((csname [self read: stream]))
      (or [csname isSymbol] (error "missing control sequence name in \\def"))
      (define-macro csname %insert [self read: stream]))
    0))
</pre></blockquote>

Finally, we associate the new active characters with their associated
methods.  We can then use our textual macros immediately, in-line in
the source file.

<blockquote><pre>
[CokeScanner readerAt: '$\\ put: cs-reader]
[CokeScanner readerAt: '$\{ put: group-reader]
[CokeScanner readerAt: '$\} put: group-error]

\def\foo 42
\def\bar{a sequence}
\def\baz{This is \bar of tokens}

[StdOut println: '(one \foo two \baz three \foo four)]
</pre></blockquote>

Running the above program produces:

<blockquote><pre>
(#one 42 #two (#This #is (#a #sequence) #of #tokens) #three 42 #four)
</pre></blockquote>

The above bear a striking resemblance to TeX macros.  Extending them
to implement the full TeX macro semantics would not be difficult
(probably no more than tripling the size of the above code). <p>

To save your typing finger, the above example is available in the idst
distribution as <tt>function/examples/macros</tt>.


<h3>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;META-II</h3>

We can add Val D. Schorre's META-II syntax [1] directly to the scanner
using an active 'escape' character.  The approach described here is
similar to that described by Henry Baker [2] for Common Lisp but
differs in that the scanner changes needed to read META expresions
will only be activated within the expression immediately following the
'escape' character. <p>

We are going to teach the scanner how to transform META markup into
AST nodes (the head will identify the META operation being encoded)
and add a 'META compiler' to the parser that will convert these
marked-up nodes into an executable recogniser.  When the scanner sees
the active 'escape' character it will read the next expression form
the stream, with META 'markup', and return the result of 'compiling'
the META program it contains to the scanner's caller (usually the Coke
compiler).  <p>

First we need a helper function, a version of 'map' that applies a
transformation to each element in a list.

<blockquote><pre>
(define meta-compile 0)	; forward

(define meta-map	; poor man's mapcar
  (lambda (function expr)
    (let ((limit  [expr size])
	  (result [Expression new: limit])
	  (index  '0))
      (while (< index limit)
	[result at: index put: (function [expr at: index])]
	(set index [index + '1]))
      result)))
</pre></blockquote>

Our 'META compiler' will deal with two kinds of object in AST nodes:
<tt>meta-form</tt> compiles a node that encode a META operation,
and <tt>meta-other</tt> compiles everything else.  Both answer true or
false depending on whether their 'match' succeeds.  By
default, <tt>meta-other</tt> succeeds if its object in the META
pattern is identical to the next element read from the input stream.
(It could be made arbitrarily more sophisticated, for example checking
structural equivalance or performing unification.)

<blockquote><pre>
(define meta-other	; default matcher for non-meta constructs within pattern
  (lambda (expr)
    `(and (== ',expr [stream peek])
	  (let () [stream next] 1))))

(define meta-form	; matchers for meta constructs
  (lambda (node)
    (let ((type [node first])
	  (expr [node second]))
      (cond
       ((== type 'meta-repeat)		`(let () (while ,(meta-compile expr)) 1))
       ((== type 'meta-predicate)	expr)
       ((== type 'meta-alternate)	`(or  ,@(meta-map meta-compile expr)))
       ((== type 'meta-sequence)	`(and ,@(meta-map meta-compile expr)))
       ((== type 'meta-unify)		(if (and [expr isArray] (== '2 [expr size]))
					    `(and (,[expr first] [stream peek])
						  (let ()
						    (set ,[expr second] [stream next])
						    1))
					    [expr error: '"syntax error near #@"]))
       (1				(meta-other node))))))
</pre></blockquote>

The META compiler recursively checks for a possible META expression
and calls <tt>meta-form</tt> or <tt>meta-form</tt> as appropriate.

<blockquote><pre>
(define meta-compile	; compile meta pattern
  (lambda (expr)
    (if (and [expr isArray] (== '2 [expr size]))
	(meta-form expr)
	(meta-other expr))))
</pre></blockquote>

A META expression will be introduced by an active 'escape' character
buried in a Coke program.  This character will invoke a meta sequence
reader.

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><td><i>expression</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td><i>meaning</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>{ e... }				<td>any one of the elements e...</td></tr>
<tr><td>[ e... ]				<td>all of the elements e... in order</td></tr>
<tr><td>$ e					<td>any number (zero or more) of e</td></tr>
<tr><td>@ ( p v )				<td>anything satisfying predicate p</td></tr>
<tr><td>					<td>that will be bound to variable v</td></tr>
<tr><td>! p					<td>the predicate p (any Coke expression)</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

The meta sequence reader looks for one of the five META characters
that prefix META expressions and converts it into a marked-up AST node
accordingly.  The META compiler recursively checks for a possible META
expression and calls <tt>meta-form</tt> or <tt>meta-form</tt> as
appropriate.

<blockquote><pre>
(define meta-sequence-reader
  (method (stream)
    (let ((delim [stream next]))
      (cond
       ((== delim '${)	[Expression with: 'meta-alternate with: [self read: stream list: Expression delimited: '$}]])
       ((== delim '$[)	[Expression with: 'meta-sequence  with: [self read: stream list: Expression delimited: '$]]])
       ((== delim '$$)	[Expression with: 'meta-repeat    with: [self read: stream]])
       ((== delim '$@)	[Expression with: 'meta-unify     with: [self read: stream]])
       ((== delim '$!)	[Expression with: 'meta-predicate with: [self read: stream]])
       (1		[self error: stream unexpected: delim])))))
</pre></blockquote>

META expressions will be prefixed by the escape character '?'.  The
scanner is temporarily modifed (for the duration of scanning the next
expression from the input stream) to add markup in response to the
above META operators.  (As in the previous example, closing delimiters
are made illegal for the duration of META expressions.)

<blockquote><pre>
(define meta-sequence-illegal
  (method (stream)
    [self error: stream unexpected: [stream next]]))

;; make ? an active character that enables meta syntax for the following expression only and then compiles the result

(define meta-sequence-escape
  (method (stream)
    [stream next]
    [self save]
    [self readerAt: '$\\ put: [self readerAt: '$$]]
    [self readerAt: '${  put: meta-sequence-reader]  [self readerAt: '$} put: meta-sequence-illegal]
    [self readerAt: '$[  put: meta-sequence-reader]  [self readerAt: '$] put: meta-sequence-illegal]
    [self readerAt: '$$  put: meta-sequence-reader]
    [self readerAt: '$@  put: meta-sequence-reader]
    [self readerAt: '$!  put: meta-sequence-reader]
    (let ((result [self read: stream]))
      [self restore]
      (meta-compile result))))

[CokeScanner readerAt: '$? put: meta-sequence-escape withAttribute: 'id]		; allow ? to appear embedded in symbols
</pre></blockquote>

The META syntax is now available immediately to the program.  We can
use it to write a parser for integers (after the example in Baker
[2]).

<blockquote><pre>
;;; Example: integer parsing (see [2, Section 1])

(define digit	(lambda (x) (and (<= '$0 x) (<= x '$9))))	; predicate

(define parse-int
  (lambda (string)
    (let ((stream [string readStream])
	  (s '1) (d  0) (n '0))
      (if ? [ { \+ [ \- !(set s '-1) ] !1 }
	      @(digit d) !(set n (send 'digitValue d))
	      $ [ @(digit d) !(set n (send '+ (send '* n '10) (send 'digitValue d))) ] ]
	  [s * n]
	  'error))))

[StdOut print: (parse-int '"0")]	[StdOut cr]
[StdOut print: (parse-int '"42")]	[StdOut cr]
[StdOut print: (parse-int '"+1")]	[StdOut cr]
[StdOut print: (parse-int '"-1")]	[StdOut cr]
[StdOut print: (parse-int '"+42")]	[StdOut cr]
[StdOut print: (parse-int '"-666")]	[StdOut cr]
[StdOut print: (parse-int '"-haha")]	[StdOut cr]
</pre></blockquote>

Running the above program produces the following output:

<blockquote><pre>
0
42
1
-1
42
-666
#error
</pre></blockquote>

To save your typing finger, the above example is available in the idst
distribution as <tt>function/examples/prag-parse</tt>.
